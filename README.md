# IOT-Based-Smart-EV-charging-Slot-Booking-System

This project is to create an efficient ecosystem for Electric Vehicle (EV) users. The most popular technology over exhaustible energy is using electric vehicle which runs on electricity. Like fuel stations, for EV’s there are charging power station.
Electric vehicle charging stations supply electricity to charge the battery of the electric vehicles.  Public charging stations, private charging stations, and home-based charging stations are the common types of electric vehicle charging stations.
But the main challenge to deal with charging stations of EV’s is management. We face two main issues which are grid management and range anxiety. Grid means charging points. To overcome this problem our portal is providing facility of slot booking that before reaching the station, we can book slot. Generally, it takes minimum 1 hour to charge the vehicle. So to save time, this web app will provide nearby power station to users.
Second one is range anxiety. We should know in advance the normal capacity of EV.  So, user should get time to time notification in advance to refill the power, whenever battery is about to discharge.
